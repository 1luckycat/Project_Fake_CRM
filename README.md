Team 3 : Mo, JeiAvonni, and Nathan

Did not receive any work from JeiAvonni or Nathan so could not merge work together.  Unfortunately, this is only Mo's code for the landing page and how it works page.


<!--Nathan didnt want to participate so changed work assignment to two people---!>
Project manager: Mo
JeiAvonni: Sign up page and Sign in page
Mo: Landing page and How it works page


<!--What was assigned in the beginning-->
Project manager: Mo
JeiAvonni:  Sign up page and Header of Landing/How-it-works (Focus on your business portion)
Mo:  Rest of the landing page and Footer of landing/how-it-works (Try double tap today)
Nathan:  Sign in page and middle portion of how -it-works
